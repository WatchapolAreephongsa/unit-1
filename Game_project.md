![](game.gif)

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

The owner of the local game shop is an enthusiast of classic computer games. He has been looking for a talented programmer that can help him revive his passion for text-based games. He has few requirements for this task:

1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.

Apart for this requirements, the owner is open to any type of game, topic or genre.

## Proposed Solution
Design Statement:
I will design and make a game for a client who is The owner of the local game shop. The game will be an RPG game about clearing the dungeon conduct using Pycharm.
It will take 3 weeks to make and evaluate according to the success criteria below.

In this project I will use python to create the text base game because of 3 main reasons. First of all, python is one of the simplest language we can use to create text based game, since python language can 
## Success Criteria

Client's
- The game has to be entirely text-based.
- The game must record the time played

   - Has 7 chapters which each chapter will have different game
- Offer players alternative ending
   -Depending on player's choices

**Figure 1.** System diagram for the proposed solution

As shown in **Fig. 1**, the proposed solution runs on Python and it is developed using Pycharm (v. 2021). The proposed game, "DNG" will be able to save player's name, score and time and it will allow the player to select the difficulty and save their check point when they die.
