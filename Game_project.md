![game](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82266864/138603002-17cc4a82-0dbb-49b6-889f-7842dbc692ea.gif)

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

The owner of the local game shop is an enthusiast of classic computer games. He has been looking for a talented programmer that can help him revive his passion for text-based games. He has few requirements for this task:

1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.

Apart for this requirements, the owner is open to any type of game, topic or genre.

## Proposed Solution
### Design Statement:
I will design and make a game for a client who is The owner of the local game shop. The game will be an RPG/story game about surviving in the killing game which its concept is inspired by the series "Squid Game", this game will be conduct using Pycharm. It willa month weeks to make and evaluate according to the success criteria below.

### Tools/ Structure Justification
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this project I will use python to create the text base game because of 3 main reasons. First of all, python is a very simple coding language compared to others. Therefore, creating a python program will take less time ,so that we can finish the final product by the time given by the client. Moreover, due to python simplicity which most of the python codes are based on English language, it's easy to understand the code and point out some mistakes or error made during the process. Secondly, despite the fact that python is very simple coding language, it also have the versatility and efficiency, python has many modules and functions which allows the creator to use it in many ways. In this project, the module time and functions for database will be use to record the player's data include name, score, time, etc which will meet the client's second and third requirements. Finally, python is the text-based coding language which mean that most of the time, python's output will be text and this meet the client's first requirement for the game to be entirely text-based.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, I will use PyCharm as the platform to create the game because PyCharm is one of the platform that allows python coding and PyCharm also has many supportive functions that help the user with many things such as pointing out user's error which will or might cause the system error. Moreover, PyCharm also allow the user to create many types of file not just .py for python but also .txt for text which help with player's record database.In addition, PyCharm is also very organized that it will sort files in user's project by name or other things depends on user's setting which allow the users to easily find and create new files for their projects. From the reason mentioned above, PyCharm is a very suitable platform for making any python's project especially for this project which we need to use .txt and many different files to create the game. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the game that I will create is the story game which I chose this kind of game because story game does not have the specific group of customers and it is very easy for anyone to understand how to enjoy the game play and story at the sametime ,since the client is the local game shop which their customer can be anyone from any age group and gender. Therefore, the concept of the game that I chose is inspired from the "Squid Game" which is the series that's very famous in every age group.

## Success Criteria

Client's
- The game has to be entirely text-based.
- The game must record the time played
- The game must record the playerâ€™s name and score.

My own criteria
- Choice game
   - Allow player to  change story and endings depends on their choice
- Story game
   - Based on Series squid game
   - Survival game
- Has 7 chapters 
   - Each chapter will have different games.

**Figure 1.** System diagram for the proposed solution

As shown in **Fig. 1**, the proposed solution runs on Python and it is developed using Pycharm (v. 2021). The proposed game, "DNG" will be able to save player's name, score and time and it will allow the player to select the difficulty and save their check point when they die. This game will be code on software macOS BigSur Ver.11.4.

**Figure 2.** System diagram for the proposed solution

As shown in **Fig. 2**, the proposed solution runs on Python 3.9 and it is developed using Pycharm (v. 2021). The proposed game, "ISAK Game" will be able to save player's name, score, time and it will save player's final status when the player die or when the player complete the game. This game will be code on software macOS BigSur Ver.11.4 on MacBook Air 2020.

**Figure 4.** Flow Diagram for decoder

The database in the game has to be protected so that personal data is not exposed. To solve this requirement I am using the Caesar cypher. Fig. 3/ Fig. 4 shows the flow diagram for this function.
