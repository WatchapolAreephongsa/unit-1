# Task 1: Prototypes and Client interaction


### Question 1: Do you think it is necessary to involve the show owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer

  I think it will be better if we involve the client in some part of the making the game to get the client’s 
feedback from time to time because the final product will be more likely to satisfy the client and we will also 
be able to change some specific part during the process from the client’s feedback. However, we shouldn’t show all 
the processes from planning, starting the game, finish the first level until the end of the game because the client
might not be able to understand the code or how it works which might disappoint the client. Instead, we should 
show the work when we finish the first usable part which in this case will be the first level of the game with a menu and tutorial.


### Question 2: Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?

  I think it is necessary to create the MVP for the game because it will help the client to have some 
pictures of how our game will look like and how does it work which I think my game’s MVP will be the first level of the
dungeon which will show the player, how to play the game(like tutorial stage) and give the basic storyline of the game.
After the client tries the MVP, I expect some feedback which might include bugs in-game, some improvement about the story, 
character controlling. From this feedback, we will learn about which part of the game is the problem and we can change those 
specific parts or create the new game if needed.

### Question 3: Do you see similarities between the Human-Centered Design cycle presented in the video and the Design Cycle we use for developing software? Explain.

I think the human-centered design cycle and the design cycle we use to develop the software are and are supposed to be similar
in many ways. I think that the way the human mind works is not very different from how the software works because humans and 
software both need simple explanations in steps to work on something. Using the door example from the video, we won’t be able 
to know what we are supposed to do in order to open the door without instruction, sometimes you need to push, sometimes pull,
or even slide. Therefore, without good and detailed instruction such as a handle to show that you need to pull this door or a sign
saying the push to tell you to push the door, it will be very common to use the door incorrectly. Same as the computer that
we need to tell them what to do such as print if with condition or loop with the condition or else the computer won’t work that out for us.
From this reason, we should use the same method for software design cycle which start with the observation or getting information of what people/client
wants and then we need to think of the way to satisfy those needs or want which is the “idea generation” process. After we know what we need to do,
we should prototype and test to see the error or the bug of the program, so we can improve our design,
so that it’s easy for both client and software to understand how the code work.

### Question 4: What are the simple principles for human-centered design presented in the video? Write a sentence with the definition of each.

Observe- Observe how people perform something to get some ideas of some problem in their life.

Idea generation- Generate some ideas that we can propose to solve those problems.

Prototype- Create the model of the solution we came up with.

Testing- Test that prototype to observe the problem of our prototype and repeat the cycle again to improve our product.

### Question 5. Consider your game. Think about ways you can improve the Players’ Experience using Human-centered design. Write below your ideas:

I think I need to start with observing other games especially text-based games to see the good part and bad parts of those games
to use to improve my game. Then I need to think about how those observed features can benefit my game. After that, I will put some features that
I think it is good into my game before testing it to see the error or bugs and repeat the cycle again to fix those bugs and improve the players’ experience.
