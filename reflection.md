# Reflection for Unit 1 Computer Science 2021 - Stop Think Write


### 1. What are the steps in design cycle.

 There are 5 main steps in the design cycle

 1. Planning 

 2. Design

 3. Development

 4. Evaluation

 5. Implementation

### 2. What is the purpose of  success criteria.

Success criteria is like the final goal of our project which can help us to know what the client or what we expect at the end of the project. From knowing the success criteria, we can make a good planning, so that we can achieve those criteria. It also like rubic that we can chect at the end of the project whether our project will satisfy the client or not.


### 3.What do you understand now about Computer/Computer Science that you did not before Unit 1.

I learned that computer doesn't have to be like our desktop or laptop but it can be any devices that work with inputted information by using mathematical processes and give some output. Before, learning computer science, I thought that the way computer work is very complicated that human cannot understand but from this course I learned that most On and off 0 and 1 or binary is the way computer work which is a lot simpler than I thought.


### 4.What do you understand now about yourself that you did not before Unit 1.

Before I took Computer Science, I thought that Comsci was a very hard subject for those that are very talented but throughtout the course, I learned that by practicing and asking questions, coding is possible eventhough I never had any experience before. I learned to think in the more computational way which not only help me with my Computer Science but also help me with my daily life, since computational thinking is a very logical way of thinking.

### 5/6.What did/did not work for you during the development of the Unit 1.

#### What work well:

-Time management-Make a time table which help me know when is the deadline for each part of the project.

-Practice- Practice what I learned before ,so I know how each thing that I learned work and how to apply it in different scenarios.

-Experiment- Try different programs/ Research more function/module/library that can aid me in the project.

-Asking other- for help and to try as beta tester.

#### What didn't work well/What I should improve:

-My plan is not detailed enough - The plan was too vague ,so that it was pretty hard to follow along.

-Success criteria wasn't achievable ,so I need to change all of my plan. - Success criteria that I setted was over my skill level and it was too hard for me to achieve it.


### 7 As a developer, you are only responsible only for the accomplishment of the success criteria. Do you agree or disagree? Defend your answer.

I think that the developer is responsible for their codes until they send the codes to the clients and get the approval since those codes or programs will be client's properties and not ours anymore. The problem that our codes might cause in the future it won't be our responsibility to fix all of those problems unless we have some contacts with clients or conditions such as if the client want us to fix some parts in order to solve the problem, we might have to.
