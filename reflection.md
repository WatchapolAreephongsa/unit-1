# Reflection for Unit 1 Computer Science 2021 - Stop Think Write


### 1. What are the steps in design cycle.

 There are 5 main steps in the design cycle

 1. Planning 

 2. Design

 3. Development

 4. Evaluation

 5. Implementation

### 2. What is the purpose of  success criteria.

Success criteria is like the final goal of our project which can help us to know what the client or what we expect at the end of the project. From knowing the success criteria, we can make a good planning, so that we can achieve those criteria. It also like rubic that we can chect at the end of the project whether our project will satisfy the client or not.


### 3.What do you understand now about Computer/Computer Science? That you did not before unit 1.

I learned that computer doesn't have to be like our desktop or laptop but it can be any devices that work with inputted information by using mathematical processes and give some output. Before, learning computer science, I thought that the way computer work is very complicated that human cannot understand but from this course I learned that most On and off 0 and 1 or binary is the way computer work which is a lot simpler than I thought.
